# Generative Adversarial Network

In this project, I aimed to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate hand-written images similar to the images in the [MNIST dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist).

## Theory
Theoretical aspects of GANs, as explained in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), are covered in the first part of the notebook. It provides an overview of how GANs work and the underlying principles behind them.

## Implementation
The network structure is divided into two main parts: the generative model and the discriminative model. These components work together to train the GAN and generate realistic hand-written images.
